# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-29)

**Core value:** An Octatrack user can manage their projects and samples with complete confidence that their creative work is never at risk — every destructive operation is snapshot-protected, previewed, and atomically applied.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Foundation) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Parser must be isolated (no Tauri, no I/O) and validated with byte-exact round-trip tests before any write path is built
- Phase 1: Clean-room spec document required before any parser code — GPL boundary with ot-tools-io is non-negotiable
- Phase 1: Atomic write staging must be on the same filesystem as the CF card volume (cross-filesystem renames are not atomic on macOS FAT32)
- Phase 3: Research flag — verify FAT32 rename atomicity with integration test on real FAT32 volume before depending on it

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 research flag: OT binary format is 31.6% undocumented; clean-room spec document creation is a research deliverable within Phase 1
- Phase 1 research flag: macOS DiskArbitration FFI for volume detection — may use `sysinfo` + `notify` Kqueue backend as alternative; validate early
- Phase 4 research flag: Cross-project bank copy slot conflict resolution has no open-source reference implementation
